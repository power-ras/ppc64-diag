.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B diag_encl
command reports the status of the various components of the SCSI
enclosure(s) specified by the
.BI sg n
device name(s).
If no enclosure is specified, all SCSI enclosures known to the system
are reported.
.P
.B diag_encl
currently supports a limited number of enclosure types
and reports an error if asked to diagnose an unrecognized type.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR or \fB\-\-disk <sgN>\fR
Collects disk health information and populates it in an xml output file
under destination directory (/var/log/ppc64-diag/diag_disk/).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-serv_event\fR
Report any faults to the servicelog database.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-cmp_prev\fR
Report only faults that are new (or have become more critical)
since the last time
.B diag_encl
was run with the
.B \-s
option.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR or \fB\-\-leds\fR
Try to turn on the fault indicator (typically an amber LED) for any
failing component.
Some components' LED(s) may not be accessible to Linux.
Some LEDs have independent fault and identify settings;
that is, the LED may be in fault mode and identify mode at the same time
(in which case both the fault setting and the identify setting bubble up
to the enclosure, which may have separate fault and identify LEDs).
.B diag_encl
doesn't affect the LED's identify setting.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR or \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Produce more verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR or \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the version of the command and exit.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR or \fB\-\-fake\fR \fIpath\fB.pg2\fR
A testing option.
Instead of querying the device,
read diagnostic information from the file whose pathname is
.IR path .pg2,
and read vital product data from the file whose pathname is
.IR path .vpd.
.TP
\fB\<scsi_enclosure>\fR
The sg device on which to operate, such as sg7; if not 
specified, all such devices will be diagnosed
.TP
\fB\-h\fR or \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a usage message and exit.
